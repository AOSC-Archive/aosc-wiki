# Welcome

Welcome to the AOSC Community Wiki!

This is where all documentations, information, and guides will gather for users and developers alike. This community wiki is currently a work-in-progress, so do expect constant content changes and movements. Anyone is welcome to make changes to this wiki as a guest, as user management backend is not yet complete on Wiki.js upstream.

The wiki is split into multiple big sections, targeting different audiences. Do use the search bar if lost though, it could come in handy.
