# Why AOSA?

The system of AOSC OS Security Advisories (AOSA) is introduced in 2017 to aid in the tracking of security vulnerabilities found in AOSC OS, and to help making our users aware of security updates available - which are often mixed-in with feature and other bug-fix updates.

# Formatting and Numbering

AOSAs follow a very simple (but organised) format with an aim to provide the immediate action suggestions, like in the example below:

```
 AOSA-2018-0008: Update WildMIDI to 0.4.2
|- A -|- B -|- C -|-------------------------|
```
