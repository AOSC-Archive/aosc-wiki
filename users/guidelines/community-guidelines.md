# Welcome to AOSC!

Hi there, welcome to the Anthon Open Source Community - our community since late 2011! 

*"All the people who live in a particular area, or a group of people who are considered as a unit because of their shared interests or background."*

— Community (n.), definition from the *[Cambridge English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/community)*

At AOSC, we consider our common interest in the discovery of fun in computing - in particular, we focus on the advancement of open source software and their localisation in our day-to-day computing. Over the years, AOSC has focused most of its development powress on the [AOSC OS](/users/information/is-aosc-os-right-for-me) project, with various other projects spinned out in its interest. For instance, earlier this year, we have created the AOSC Retro Computing group, where vintage computing enthusiasts find their common topics in finding and buying them, restoring and playing with them, and porting a specially configured AOSC OS distribution on them.

# Rationale: Why a Guideline?

As suggested by its dictionary meaning, AOSC is a community of people, and its functions are carried out through years of inter-personal interactions. These inter-personal interactions, successful or not, has defined our sense of community, "a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met through their commitment to be together." (*McMillan & Chavis, 1986*).

Given this, it is necessary to explain our community's values and common understandings - *however, not in interest of limiting or implying penalty upon any actions not in accordance to these values and understandings.*

# The Guidelines

As most of our community activities are organised and communicated across multiple Telegram groups, the guidelines below will be organised into "community-wide" and "group-specific." Again, with an empasis that these guidelines are:

*Not in interest of limiting or implying penalty upon any actions not in accordance to these values and understandings.*

## Community Wide

1. The freedom of expression is generally guaranteed in our community, but keep in mind that not all would be happy with what you are saying or implying. Consider this point common sense, and skip ahead if confident.
	a. Arguments happen, don't hope for chatting group admins to break it up - just use your intelligence to help work it out (and some who are really good at working out arguments are admins in the first place). Respect is the only way against 
	- Call people whatever you like, as long as they are happy with that and it doesn't confuse the people involved.
	- Profanities are by no means banned, but consider if it helps with expressing your argument - and that it *really fucking* annoys people if used excessively.
	- Use whatever language you may like, but be aware of others' language proficiency. Quick tip: most members speak and write Chinese and English, so translations may help when needed (and they are generally grateful).
2. 

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct?

Our community is built upon the given sense of community, and fulfilled by our said interests in computing - maintained (or discontinued) and managed upon the will of its members. While good in its intention, the *[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct)* is unsuitable and unproductive for our functions.

We believe that our community members should grow from years of their own work and contribution, and find their recognition through technical understandings and their own characters. The static set of so-called personal "standards," as defined in C.C.C.o.C., deminishes the emphasis on human understanding and attempts to codify them as though they are already found to be universal.

In its "Our Responsibilities" chapter:

*"Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful."*

It is a simple condition that our development infrastructures are used as tools for development (as it obviously suggests). Understanding this, *any* non-development activities should have been banned in the first place, and *any* forms of abuse should be condemned upon our common understanding. The C.C.C.o.C. uses four overly vague (and not to mention, overlapping) adjectives to describe the so-called unacceptable behaviours, and does not stand in interest of those who could have been wrongly accused. Upholding the exclusivity of development infrastructures for development purposes is an effective method to prevent such abuse (or any form of unnecessary accusations) during our development processes.

Furthermore, the C.C.C.o.C.'s description of the "enforcement" process stands against this understanding and the actual nature of our community:

*"Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership."*

Our community is managed by its contributors, while a founder (and therefore a *de facto* leader) exists, he (Mingcong Bai) recognises that his power is only shared with the contributors. There is no clear administrative divide from contributors/maintainers/... from the founder - this process stands invalid in the scope of our community.

In conclusion, the C.C.C.o.C. does not recognise the possibility of a non-hierarchical community and assumes much in the meaning of words - it is unsuitable, unproductive, and possibly dangerous to adopt this Code in our community.
