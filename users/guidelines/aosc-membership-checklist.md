# AOSC Membership Enrollment Checklist
Every person, animal, AI, and other lifeforms are welcomed to contribute to the AOSC community. Once you have made some contributions, including packaging, providing server resources, and etc., we will regard you as a member of AOSC.

You may request an AOSC account if you are a member. To do so, you may directly ask in AOSC telegram groups or ask any of the admins (@JeffBai, for example). You will be asked to provide your preferred login name, first name and last name (to identify you, no need to be the legal name). If you are willing to help us package, you need to provide your SSH public key as well.

Here we provide a checklist for any admin to create a new account.

- [ ] Create a LDAP Account (ask @xiaoxing).
- [ ] Create a Mail account (@aosc.io/aosc.xyz) (ask @JeffBai).
- [ ] Create a new people page in GitHub, consult [this guide](https://wiki.aosc.io/en/developers/community-portal#add-new-personal-pages) if you are unsure.
- [ ] [Enroll the public key in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/dev-pubkeys) if needed.
- [ ] Enroll the public key on the repo server if needed (ask @xiaoxing).
