Minutes

## AOSC Moe-ification (.. cont'd)

- Bai: On the subject of species, should it be more humanoid or animal like?
    - Bai: I prefer humanoid design, what do you guys think?
    - Saki: Human
    - Staph: Not animal
- Liu: On the subject of character features?
- Bai: His (Tyson) interpretation is not very accurate
- Leo: The character feature should not be "so mild" in the sense
- Yhi: It's just designer's interpretation of our community which he does not know too much about us
- Bai: Yes. That's why we are discussing about it
- Yhi: Is there anything about this topic before?
- Bai: Yes. In the last week's minutes
- Bai: She should be shy
- Bai: However "don't even communicate with normal people" is not very accurate
- Staph: Like Cipher suite negotitation?
- Liu: Mostly shy, but when met with a person with common interests, she will be very talk-active
- Bai: Inclusion, the mascot: 1. Not so eccentric, she's a normal person; 2. Shy, but when met with a person with common interests, she will be talk-active and filled with anti-humors(?)

## OSPP

(Going over the promotional/introductional slides together)

## Autobuild3

- Bai: There have been some changes made to `autobuild3`. There might be more errors incoming.
- Bai: I made a QA branch dedicated to QA checks. QA checks are divided into pre- and post-build checks.
- Bai: Also I will implement test functionality into `autobuild3`. It will run all the scripts under `autobuild/tests/` and we may have some standard template tests implemented.
- Liu: I think we better off only provide some functions exported from `autobuild3` to be used `autobuild/tests` scripts. Since there will be more consistency issues than build systems.
- Bai: Okay, we will hold-off this function for now.

## AOINB

## AOSCBootstrap and DeployKit

- Bai: Can DeployKit make use of AOSCBootstrap when installing from scratch?
- Yhi: Doable. It's just commandline invokation.
- Bai: Okay.

Actionables
-----------

- Liu: Reply the email to Tyson with the conclusions above after the meeting. Mention the name of the mascot.
- Yhi: Ready the slides and speaker notes. Dry-run on next Wednesday.
- Staph: Prepare the shorter version of his OSPP project summary. Due next Wednesday.
