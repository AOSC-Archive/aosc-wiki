# What is Ciel?

Ciel is a multi-instance management frontend for [BuildKit](/developers/buildkit) containers based on [systemd-nspawn](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html). Ciel also manages Autobuild3/ACBS configurations, ABBS trees, APT repositories, network behaviours, and various other aspects that affect the build environments.
