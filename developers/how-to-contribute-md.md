# Preparing Your Content

Using Wiki.js, the Community Wiki is written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Sections

As currently planned, our Community Wiki is arranged across 5 sections:

- Developers: This section contains guidebooks for AOSC developers, as well as more technically-inclined content for developers using AOSC OS.
- Users: This section contains information useful for AOSC OS users with pages arranged by topics.
- Errata: This section contains known *unresolved* issues found in AOSC OS for developers' and users' reference.
- Knowledge Base: This section contains pages describing resolved issues and commonly asked questions in AOSC OS.
- AOSA: This section lists all current and historic AOSC OS Security Advisories.
