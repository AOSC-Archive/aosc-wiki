# 欢迎来到 AOSC 社区！

欢迎来到创建于 2011 年的安同开源社区 (AOSC) ！

*"All the people who live in a particular area, or a group of people who are considered as a unit because of their shared interests or background."*

— Community (n.), definition from the *[Cambridge English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/community)*

作为安同开源社区的一分子，我们共同的爱好就是探索计算机技术，特别是开源软件的发展和本地化。数年来，安同开源社区将大部分的精力放在了 [AOSC OS](/sys-is-aosc-os-right-for-me) 项目，以及多个社区感兴趣的项目。例如在 2019 年我们就创建了 AOSC Retro Computing Group，为古董电脑爱好者提供了一个购买、折腾、玩耍古董电脑、甚至为这些电脑移植 AOSC OS 的平台。

# 为什么需要一个准则？

没有多年的人与人的交流与碰撞，是不会有安同开源社区的。无论这些互动最后成功与否，它们都影响到了我们的社群意识。有鉴于此，有必要对我们社区的价值观做出一个解释。在我们列出所有具体的指导方针之前，这个准则列出了所有适用于所有社区成员的没任何争议的准则。

*但总的来说，我们并不想对任何不符合这些价值观的行为做出限制或处罚。* 

# 准则

这一部分包含了一些我们社区*没有争议*的准则。

- 安同开源社区永远会是一个*独立的为爱好者和发烧友准备的社区*。
- 安同开源社区*不会*为贡献者提供金钱和物质上的回报。
- 安同开源社区*不会*容忍任何形式的剽窃行为。

# 指导方针

我们社区大部分的活动和交流在 Telegram 群组上开展，以下的方针会被分为“适用与全社区”和“适用于特定场景”两部分。*我们不会，也没有这个权利，去约束、限制社区成员在社区（包含所有安同开源社区 Telegram 群组、[AOSC 维基](/)、[GitHub 组织](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/) 和 [社区门户](https://aosc.io/)）外的任何行为。*

对于每一个部分，我们的指导方针又被进一步分为硬规则和软规则：

- Hard Rules are specified that *all* members of the community must comply, and failure to comply will result in penalties (specified under each categories).
	- Admins who fails to comply will be stripped of their title immediately, and (at the same time) penalised with the same severity.
- Soft Rules are specified as guidelines, and are only *suggestions* with the hope to maintain civilised, productive, and fun conversations. Failure to adhere to these Soft Rules will only make you increasingly unwelcomed, so keep that in mind.

## 适用与全社区

The rules specified below applies to all AOSC Telegram Groups, the [GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/), the [AOSC Wiki](/), and the [Community Portal](https://aosc.io/).

### 硬规则

1. Discussions of politics, violence, religion, sex, and crime are banned community-wide with one exception - the [Tuosai (托腮)](https://t.me/joinchat/BMnG9zvfjCgZUTIAoycKkg) channel.
	- Offenders (including those participating in the topic) will be asked to stop. Repeated offenses will result in a one-time community-wide ban (you may re-enter immediately, but take the hint and stop).
2. Suicidal topics, discussion of its methods, "live coverage" of your own or others suicide attempts are banned community-wide *with no exception*.
	- Offenders (including those participating in the topic) will be *immediately* subjected to a one-time community-wide ban (you may re-enter immediately, but take the hint and stop).
3. Aggravated verbal abuse and humiliation of the members or their implied relatives are banned community-wide *with no exception*.
	- This does not include occasionally used profanities, or those used jokingly or to strengthen the tone - however, if anyone were to be annoyed, stop.
	- Offenders (including those participating in the topic) will be asked to stop. Repeated offenses will result in a one-time community-wide ban (you may re-enter immediately, but take the hint and stop).
4. Humiliation and discrimination of any person, religion, ideology, location, ... are banned community-wide *with no exception*.
	- Offenders (including those participating in the topic) will be asked to stop. Repeated offenses will result in a one-time community-wide ban (you may re-enter immediately, but take the hint and stop).
5. Overly long messages that should have been posted to the [AOSC Pastebin](https://pastebin.aosc.io/) or alternatives are banned community-wide *with no exception*.
	- Offenders will be asked to stop. Repeated offenses will result in a one-time community-wide ban (you may re-enter immediately, but take the hint and stop).
6. Bot spamming are banned community-wide *with no exception*.
	- Offenders will be *immediately* subjected to a one-time community-wide ban (you may re-enter immediately, but take the hint and stop).

### 软规则

1. Respect freedom of expression.
	- Arguments happen, don't hope for channel admins to break it up - just use your intelligence to help work it out (and some who are really good at working out arguments are admins in the first place). Mutual respect is the only effective mean to prevent personal attack.
	- Call people whatever you like, as long as they are happy with that and it doesn't confuse the people involved.
	- No one can avoid disagreements over their opinions, resorting to verbal abuse can only harm your argument.
	- Profanities are by no means banned, but do ponder if it helps with expressing your argument - and be aware that it *really fucking* annoys people if used excessively.
	- Use whatever language you may like, but be aware of others' language proficiency. Quick tip: most members speak and write Chinese and English, so translations may help when needed (and they are generally grateful).
2. Be humourous, as we love memes.
	- Our [AOSCC Sticker Packs](https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aoscc/tree/master/2019/stickers) are made from our own jokes - all from our conversations!
3. Understand that you are unique, but not special.
	- People listen to you because they are interested, and they do not have to do as you say.
4. Coordinate topic changes, and avoid concurrent discussion.
	- Concurrent discussions in a single channel are confusing and unproductive.
	- Control the length of your discussion, even if your discussion have a huge following, do not last it for a whole day - it's just not nice.
5. Stick to the topic - if you are in the Retro Computing channel, don't discuss your brand new MacBook there.


## Main Group, and AOSC Workgroups

The "Main Group (AOSC 社区频道; or referred to as 主群组)" is dedicated for AOSC project-related, and other relevant technological topics - this is the main location for development discussion. There are also other channels strictly used for AOSC-related work, as listed below:

- AOSC Pak Squad
- AOSC infra-wg

Please adhere to all Community Wide rules specified above, and all additional rules specified below:

### Hard Rules

1. The use of Telegram Stickers and GIFs are banned.
	- You may use emoji, emoticon (kaomoji), and character-based expressions instead.
	- Pictures and videos relevant to technical discussions are allowed.
	- Offenders (including those participating in the topic) will be asked to stop. Repeated offenses will result in a one-time community-wide ban (you may re-enter immediately, but take the hint and stop).

### Soft Rules

1. Limit meme-ing and jokes - have fun, but not party.

## The Tuosai (托腮) Channel

Name in Chinese "AOSC 托腮群及招待点". Please note all "Community Wide" rules specified above, and the exception(s) given to this particular channel.

## Interest Groups

AOSC's "Interest Groups" include:

- AOSC Memes (AOSC 梗)
- AOSC Moe-ification
- AOSC Retro Computing
- AOSCC Sticker Squad

Please note all "Community Wide" rules specified above.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct?

Our community is built upon the given sense of community, and fulfilled by our said interests in computing - maintained (or discontinued) and managed upon the will of its members. While good in its intention, the *[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct)* is unsuitable and unproductive for our community functions.

We believe that our community members should grow from years of their own work and contribution, and find their recognition through technical understandings and their own characters. The static set of so-called personal "standards," as defined in C.C.C.o.C., diminishes the emphasis on human understanding and attempts to codify them as though they are already found to be universal.

In its "Our Responsibilities" chapter:

*"Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful."*

It is a simple condition that our development infrastructures are used as tools for development (as it obviously suggests). Understanding this, *any* non-development activities should have been banned in the first place, and *any* forms of abuse should be condemned upon our common understanding. The C.C.C.o.C. uses four overly vague (and not to mention, overlapping) adjectives to describe the so-called unacceptable behaviours, and does not stand in interest of those who could have been wrongly accused. Upholding the exclusivity of development infrastructures for development purposes is an effective method to prevent such abuse (or any form of unnecessary accusations) during our development processes.

Furthermore, the C.C.C.o.C.'s description of the "enforcement" process stands against this understanding and the actual nature of our community:

*"Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership."*

Our community is managed by its contributors, while a founder (and therefore a *de facto* leader) exists, he (Mingcong Bai) recognises that his power is only shared with the contributors. There is no clear administrative divide from contributors/maintainers/... from the founder - this process stands invalid in the scope of our community.

In conclusion, the C.C.C.o.C. does not recognise the possibility of a non-hierarchical community and assumes much in the meaning of words - it is unsuitable, unproductive, and possibly dangerous to adopt this Code in our community.
